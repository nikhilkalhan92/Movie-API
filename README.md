#  Layout and Responsiveness

Grid System: I used Bootstrap's grid system to organize movie cards into a flexible and responsive layout, displaying 4 movies per row on medium to large devices.

Card Design: Each movie is presented in a card layout, offering a clean and structured look. Custom styling was applied to card borders and titles to enhance visual appeal and maintain consistency with the overall color scheme of the application.

# Search Functionality

Implementation: A search input allows users to filter movies by title.

Design Choice: The decision to include live search reflects my commitment to usability

# Accessibility and Usability

Contrast and Fonts: Careful attention was paid to text contrast and font sizes, ensuring the website is for all users.

# Future Enhancements

Advanced Filtering: Introducing filters for genres, ratings, and release years could provide users with more refined control over the movie selection process.

# Challenges faced

Issues synching the movie.json file to show on the main website page - I consoled log the data and it appeared on the console. Eventually I got it to work.
